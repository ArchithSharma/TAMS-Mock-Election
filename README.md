# Thanks for coming to see TAMS's democracy!

## How to use all the files:

ElectionResults.csv is the data containing all 115 ballots of TAMS. It contains the wing and election data.

It is then read into Election.R, where the analysis takes place. See the code for how to further play with the data.

All of it is reported in [the election results document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gt8XcAaAC4ZGssCbV3JUG-zvcyKE3h-e/view?usp=sharing). You're free to use this code/data however you want, but if you do something cool, tell me!
