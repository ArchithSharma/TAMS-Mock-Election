# Thanks for coming to see TAMS's democracy!

## How to use all the files:

ElectionResults.csv is the data containing all 115 ballots of TAMS. It contains the wing and election data.

It is then read into Election.R, where the analysis takes place. If you're a Python nerd, then you can use Election.py (I am inclusive, don't worry).

All of it is reported in [the election results document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gt8XcAaAC4ZGssCbV3JUG-zvcyKE3h-e/view?usp=sharing). You're free to use this code/data however you want, but if you do something cool, tell me!
